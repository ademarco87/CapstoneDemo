# CS-499 Capstone Portfolio — Alexander DeMarco  

This repository contains the artifacts and enhancements for my **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) Computer Science Capstone (CS-499)**.  
The work here represents my growth as a developer, with emphasis on **secure coding, algorithms & data structures, and database design**.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into two families of artifacts:  

### **Family 1 — C++ Client System**  
Focus: **Software Design & Algorithms**  
- **CapstoneDemoOrigin**  
  - Original reverse-engineered C++ client management system.  
- **CapstoneDemoEnhancement1**  
  - *Enhancement 1: Software Design & Engineering*  
  - Removed hardcoded credentials, introduced `.env` configuration, improved modularity, and added secure login.  
- **CapstoneDemoEnhancement2**  
  - *Enhancement 2: Algorithms & Data Structures*  
  - Replaced static arrays with `std::vector`, added modular functions, improved file I/O persistence, and strengthened error handling.  

### **Family 2 — Python CRUD Dashboard**  
Focus: **Databases & Secure Systems**  
- **CapstoneDemoE3Origin**  
  - Original Python/MongoDB CRUD dashboard built with Plotly Dash.  
- **CapstoneDemoEnhancement3**  
  - *Enhancement 3: Databases*  
  - Refactored project with mock/test data, stronger input validation, optional hashed password logic, and improved documentation for a security-first mindset.
